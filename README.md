# *Fine-Tuning distilBERT - Sentiment Analysis*

This repository demonstrates the application of Fine-Tuning on a distilBERT model for sentiment analysis. Using the IMDB dataset, the model was trained to classify sentences as positive or negative. The final application allows users to input text and receive a sentiment prediction in a simple and effective manner.

## **Objective**

The main goal of this project is to showcase my skills in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and demonstrate the deployment of a trained NLP model in a lightweight Node.js application.

## **Technologies Used**

+ **Python / Hugging Face Transformers:** For training and fine-tuning distilBERT.

+ **PyTorch:** Deep learning framework for model training.

+ **Pandas & Scikit-learn:** For data processing and model evaluation.

+ **Node.js / Express:** To expose the trained model via an API.

## **How to Install and Run**

+ Clone this repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/o-lucascarvalho/Fine-Tunning-distilBERT---Sentimental-Analysis.git
  cd Fine-Tunning-distilBERT---Sentimental-Analysis

+ Install dependencies:

  ```bash
    npm install

+ Start the server:

  ```bash
    npm start

+ Open the application in your browser. The application will run in localhost:3000


## **Usage Instructions**

+ Access the application page.

+ Enter a phrase in the text box.

+ Click the submit button.

+ The result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

## **Conclusion**

This project showcases the ability to train, fine-tune, and integrate an LLM into a functional application. The focus was on making inference efficient and accessible while highlighting my expertise in Machine Learning, NLP, and deploying trained models.
